# crm-server

Remotely hosted at: https://judah-levi-crm-server.herokuapp.com

**Project Scope:**

This project was initially described as a CRM SaaS application for managing students in an academic environment, however it can apply to any customer management related application. Due to the intial project requirements, which included the usage of various classes of objects to manage data flow, there are some unused artifacts in the code base. I find,however, that it would be much simpler and cleaner to pass data directly from the route to the database. Hence in the future some of the unused features should be cleaned up. 

**Notable Features:**

This project includes a remote-deployed mongoDB integration, Authentication with JWT, Password-hashing with Argon2, Docker containerization and cloud deployment via Heroku.
